# HEAT / Jacobi Method

This is a parallel MPI implementation of the iterative [Jacobi method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method) for solving linear systems of equations.

To compile this application you'll need an MPI distribution with ULFM support enabled.

## Building the versions

### Building the NOFT version

```sh
make jacobi_noft
```

### Building the ULFM version

```sh
make jacobi_ulfm
```

### Building the SCR version

```sh
make jacobi_scr
```

### All versions

```sh
make all
```

## Running the versions

After compile with `make`, Examples of how to run the different versions are below.

### Running the NOFT version

```sh
mpirun -np <NP> jacobi_noft -p <NR> -q <NC> -NB <QC> [-MB <QR>]
```

### Running the ULFM version

```sh
mpirun --with-ft=ulfm --oversubscribe -np <NP> jacobi_ulfm -p <NR> -q <NC> -NB <QC> [-MB <QR>]
```

### Running the SCR version

```sh
mpirun -np <NP> jacobi_scr -p <NR> -q <NC> -NB <QC> [-MB <QR>] [--debug] [--use-scr-need-checkpoint]
```

Flags:

- --debug: Print debug information (not only SCR debug default messages)
- --use-scr-need-checkpoint: Use SCR_Need_checkpoint to checkpoint the application
- --run-until-success (only for jacobi_scr) If specified, run the command until it returns 0  (caution: this may cause an infinite loop)
- --retry-delay <delay_time> (only if --run-until-success is specified) Delay time in seconds between retries. Default: 1 second.

### Arguments

- binary: Binary to be executed (jacobi_noft, jacobi_ulfm or jacobi_scr if compiled with `make`)
- flag_file: File with the flags to be used by the application
- NP: Number of processes used by the application
- NR: Number of processes per row
- NC: Number of processes per column
- QC: Number of columns
- QR: Number of rows

## Cleaning

To remove all files generated by the compilation process, run:

```sh
make clean
```

## Troubleshooting

If `make jacobi_scr` isn't working, make sure you have the `SCR_ROOT` environment variables set to the SCR installation directory.
